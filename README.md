Best Data Science Tutorials and Top Data Scientists to Follow

## Introduction

Twitter started the trend of ‘People to Follow’. This later got replicated by other platforms such as Facebook, Linkedin, Quora and GitHub. This cool feature lets you connect with the rockstars of various domains and get an access to what is going on their end without bothering them much. For the influencers, this has become an effective way to communicate with their followers.

The lives of people on GitHub doesn’t appear to as tempting as you would observe on other platforms, but if you love coding, programming and data science, you’ll surely enjoy the company of 9 million users on this platform!

Following influencers is usually a good practice. It has helped me in multiple ways:

Whenever I run out of inspiration, I look at these influencers and see what they have achieved. This brings back the energy and I am back on my projects
You can follow these influencers to see which events are they attending, what are they reading and what are they working on. This can quickly become a wealth of knowledge in itself.
To some extent, it also provides a human touch to these influencers. By just looking at their profiles, they might come across as some one out of the world. But, when you start folllowing them regularly, you tend to relate yourself with the influencers.
If you haven’t tried this yet, it’s your turn now. I have compiled a list of some awesome Data Scientists on GitHub. In addition, you’ll also find the list of best data science tutorials available on GitHub. Specially for beginners, if don’t know about GitHub, here’s the quick introduction in simple words.

### What is GitHub?

You can best understand GitHub as a social network for coders across the globe. Coders across the world can share their codes and work in collaborative manner using GitHub. GitHub started in 2008 and is a web based platform which provides online project hosting using Git.

Git is a version control system which helps you save various versions of your project in the original form and allows you to retrieve them later without any problem. Git was created by Linus Torvalds (he also created Linux) and has been a boon to programmers across the world. It is a free, open source platform, where programmers from all over the world can save, display their codes. GitHub has not only made procuring codes an easy task, but have also rendered immense support to the programmers, coders worldwide.

To be honest, it is difficult to imagine the programming world without Git today!

 

### 4 Amazing Facts About GitHub

GitHub Inc. was originally known as Logical Awesome
Github reached to 1 million repositories in 2010, 2 million in 2011 and 10 million repositories in 2013. As of 2015, it has over 21 million repositories and 9 million users.
Approximately, two-thirds of the employees at GitHub work remotely.
Majority of the coders community on GitHub is of Ruby, JavaScript, PHP and Python.
 

## Data Science Tutorials on GitHub

Now, if you are new to GitHub, you would be asking, where do tutorials come in on a platform meant for version control and sharing of codes. Well, because of its niche community, a lot of people have started creating resource repositories on GitHub.
